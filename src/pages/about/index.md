### Kasese, Uganda

KCHEF focuses on Kasese and the Rwenzori district of southwestern Uganda. Although a community of extreme poverty, it holds extraordinary resilience and promise for a future in local leadership who believe in and meet high standards for transparency and competence in health and education services.

### Who are we?

KCHEF (formerly the Bishop Masereka Christian Foundation) is a collaboration of Ugandans and U.S. supporters to develop and achieve self-sufficiency.

As a locally-led organization, KCHEF represents the single most effective way to empower a community in a region severely impacted by conflict, disease, and extreme poverty.

### What do we do?

The mission of KCHEF serves the community of Kasese through health care for women and infants and education for children.

-   The Education Program provides critically needed education to more than 450 vulnerable children in primary and secondary school as well as vocational and university education.
-   The clinic meets the daily medical needs of at least 100 patients a day, most of them women and children.
-   The clinic staff manages community outreach programs to deliver public health services to outlying communities including childhood vaccinations, male circumcision and pre-natal care.

The steadfast delivery of excellent health and education services to the people of the region fuels our optimism for and commitment to the mission in Kasese. Now is the time to recommit and re-invest in its work to save lives through health and education.

##### Non-Profit Status

The Kasese Community Health and Education Foundation, a non-governmental agency, partners with the U.S. organization – Community Health and Education for Rural Africa (CHERA). CHERA is a registered 501(c)(3) corporation in the state of New York. Both organizations are committed to supporting an enlightened, healthy and self-sustaining region, to becoming a center of excellence for the provision of maternal and child health services, and to provide holistic support to students without other means of support. KCHEF and CHERA are committed to the principles of accountability, professionalism, honesty, care, respect for every person, trust, non-discrimination, and strategic partnerships.
